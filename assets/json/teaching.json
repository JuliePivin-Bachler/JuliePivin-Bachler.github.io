The course offers a practice-oriented learning experience in which students apply Human-Computer Interaction methods to design an interactive high-fidelity prototype. Students engage in a user-centered design process where they conduct user research, prototype solutions, iterative prototyping based on user feedback, and reflection on the ethical implications of their design choices. The course combines lectures, prototyping lab sessions, and skills workshops (e.g., 3D printing).",
