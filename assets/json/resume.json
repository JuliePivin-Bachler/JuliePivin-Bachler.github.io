In particular, he used the idea of light quanta (photons) to explain experimental results, but stressed the importance of the experimental results. The importance of his work on the photoelectric effect earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921."}],"skills":[{"name":"Physics","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Quantum Mechanics","Quantum Computing","Quantum Information","Quantum Cryptography","Quantum Communication","Quantum Teleportation"]}],"languages":[{"language":"French","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"English","fluency":"Fluent","icon":""},{"language":"Spanish","fluency":"Conversational","icon":""},{"language":"Dutch","fluency":"Basic knowledge","icon":""}],"interests":[{"name":"Physics","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Quantum Mechanics","Quantum Computing","Quantum Information","Quantum Cryptography","Quantum Communication","Quantum Teleportation"]}]}
