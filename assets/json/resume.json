Pivin-Bachler","image":"","email":"julie@pivin-bachler.eu","summary":"Currently completing a PhD in Cybernetics (expected to end in November 2026), I am a curious and motivated researcher focused on non-standard cases in computing. My research addresses accessibility for users with impairments, alongside issues of data imbalance and model generalizability. I also work a lot with biosignals for affect recognition. I am driven to conduct research that has tangible social impact to help others.","location":{"city":"Utrecht","countryCode":"the Netherlands"}},"current position":[{"name":"Department of Information and Computing Sciences, Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands","position":"PhD Candidate in Cybernetics","url":"https://www.uu.nl/staff/JRPivinBachler","startDate":"2022-11-01","summary":"Expected graduation in November 2026.","highlights":["Topic: Handling non-standard cases in computing from users' and models' perspectives","Promotor: Prof. dr. dr.
